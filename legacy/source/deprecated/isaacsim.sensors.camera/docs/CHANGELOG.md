# Changelog

## [1.7.8] - 2026-05-18
### Fixed
- Log a warning when `Camera.set_frequency()` / `set_dt()` fall back to "process all frames" because `/app/runLoops/main/rateLimitFrequency` is unset, instead of silently discarding the requested value

## [1.7.7] - 2026-05-10
### Fixed
- Raise a clear error when `Camera.attach_annotator()` is called before `Camera.initialize()`

## [1.7.6] - 2026-05-08
### Fixed
- Fix `CameraView` docstring listing `int32` for `instance_segmentation_fast` and `instance_id_segmentation_fast`; runtime dtype is `uint32` (matches `ANNOTATOR_SPEC` and `semantic_segmentation`)

## [1.7.5] - 2026-04-21
### Changed
- Updated deprecation warning and Overview.md to reference `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.rtx` (was `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.camera`)

## [1.7.4] - 2026-04-17
### Fixed
- Fix `Camera.set_dt` rejecting valid sub-rendering-rate frequencies due to float modulo precision
- Fix `Camera.get_dt` returning -1.0 when rendering frequency is unknown (now returns 0.0)
- Fix `set_fisheye_polynomial_properties` silently skipping valid 0.0 values due to bare truthiness checks
- Fix `set_kannala_brandt_properties` warning message saying "expecting 5" when guard enforces minimum 4
- Fix case-sensitive `"pinhole"` substring check failing for `"opencvPinhole"` in 4 projection methods
- Fix `set_lens_distortion_model("pinhole")` removing all applied schemas instead of only lens distortion schemas
