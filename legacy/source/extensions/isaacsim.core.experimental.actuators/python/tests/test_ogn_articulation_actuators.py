"""Tests for the OgnArticulationActuators OmniGraph node.

These tests verify the *wrapper layer* — the OGN-specific wiring that lives in
OgnArticulationActuators.py — rather than re-proving the physics accuracy of
ArticulationActuators (which has its own thorough test suite).

What each test is responsible for
----------------------------------
* That the node is registered under the right OGN type string.
* That lazy initialisation fires on the first ``execIn`` pulse, not at graph-creation
  time.
* That ``autoStepPrePhysics=True`` (default) lets the pre-physics callback drive
  stepping while ``execIn`` is still responsible for seeding feedforward.
* That ``autoStepPrePhysics=False`` causes ``step_actuators`` to be called
  manually on each ``execIn`` pulse, so the joint only moves when the graph fires.
* That with ``autoStepPrePhysics=False`` and no ``execIn`` wired, the joint does
  not move and no effort is written — confirming that stepping is strictly gated
  on ``execIn`` and not triggered by any other internal code path.
* That ``feedforwardCommand`` values flow correctly through to
  ``set_dof_feedforward_effort_targets``.
* That the optional ``dofIndices`` input narrows which DOFs the feedforward
  targets.
* That changing ``autoStepPrePhysics`` at runtime (without rebuilding the graph)
  forwards the change to the underlying ``ArticulationActuators`` without crashing.

OmniGraph primer (for readers new to OGN testing)
--------------------------------------------------
* ``og.Controller.edit(...)`` builds an Action Graph *in Python* — the same graph
  you would build by clicking in the Visual Scripting editor.  The graph lives in
  the USD stage and is torn down with it.
* ``"evaluator_name": "execution"`` means the graph is an *Action Graph*: nodes
  only compute when an execution token travels along an edge.  Setting attribute
  values and calling ``og.Controller.evaluate`` alone does NOT trigger
  ``compute()``; a pulse must flow through ``execIn``.
* ``OnPlaybackTick`` emits a tick (i.e. an execution token) on every app update
  *while the timeline is playing*.  Connecting it to ``execIn`` means the node
  runs once per physics step.
* ``ogts.OmniGraphTestCase`` is the OGN-aware base class.  It calls
  ``omni.usd.get_context().new_stage_async()`` in its own ``setUp``, so our
  ``setUp`` must call ``super().setUp()`` first to get a fresh stage and then
  add the robot reference on top of it.

        This is the *negative control* for the manual-stepping path.  It confirms
        that ``step_actuators`` is truly gated on ``execIn`` and that the node does
        not secretly drive the joint through some other code path.

        Setup
        -----
        * A PD actuator (Kp=100, Kd=10) is authored so the joint *would* converge
          if efforts were applied.
        * The graph is built with ``autoStepPrePhysics=False`` and ``connect_tick=False``,
          so ``OnPlaybackTick`` is **not** wired to ``execIn``.
        * ``feedforwardCommand=[100.0]`` is set as a static graph-attribute value
          (a large effort that would cause noticeable motion if ever applied).
        * We fire ``execIn`` exactly **once** via ``og.Controller.evaluate`` *before*
          play.  This lazy-initialises the node (constructing the
          ``ArticulationActuators``) and causes ``_on_physics_ready`` to subscribe.
          Critically, this single evaluate happens before physics starts, so
          ``_on_physics_ready`` hasn't run yet and no effort is applied.

        Why the initial evaluate is needed
        -----------------------------------
        Without it the node is never initialised and the ``_on_physics_ready``
        event subscription is never registered.  The PhysX drive gains from USD
        would then remain active and could move the joint on their own, which
        would make the "joint stays still" assertion unreliable.  By firing
        ``execIn`` once we ensure:

        1. The ``ArticulationActuators`` instance is created.
        2. ``_on_physics_ready`` fires when we call ``play()``, zeroing the PhysX
           drive gains so the joint has no hidden drive force acting on it.
        3. Because ``auto_step_pre_physics=False``, the pre-physics callback is
           *not* registered, so ``step_actuators`` is never called automatically.

        After play(), no further ``execIn`` pulses arrive (``OnPlaybackTick`` is not
        connected), so ``compute()`` is never called again, meaning:
        * ``set_dof_feedforward_effort_targets`` is never invoked.
        * ``step_actuators`` is never invoked.
        * The 100 N·m ``feedforwardCommand`` value sits in the graph as an inert
          attribute that nobody reads.

        Assertions
        ----------
        * Joint position stays near its start value (≤ 0.001 rad) — no motion.
        * ``get_dof_efforts()`` ≈ 0 — no effort was ever written to the physics
          simulation, which is the *direct cause* of no motion.  This makes the
          test self-explanatory: even if the joint had gravity or some friction
          artefact, zero efforts confirm the node never ran.

        """Verify that changing `inputs:robotPath` destroys the old `ArticulationActuators` and builds a new one.

        Procedure
        ---------
        1. Build the graph pointing at /World/A_0 (PD actuator on its revolute DOF).
        2. Play for 120 steps — the revolute joint on A_0 converges to a target.
        3. Stop.
        4. Add /World/A_1 with its own PD actuator on the revolute DOF.
        5. Change inputs:robotPath to /World/A_1.
        6. Replay — first OnPlaybackTick delivers execIn → reinit → _on_physics_ready
           zeroes A_1's drive gains.
        7. Assert that A_1's stiffness and damping are 0.0.

        Why zeroed drive gains prove re-initialisation
        -----------------------------------------------
        ``ArticulationActuators._on_physics_ready`` is the *only* thing that
        ever calls ``set_dof_gains(stiffnesses=0, dampings=0, ...)`` on A_1.
        The test framework never touches drive gains directly.  So if A_1's
        stiffness and damping are 0 after the first tick of Phase 2, a new
        ``ArticulationActuators`` was definitely constructed for A_1.

        A_1 must have at least one actuator for this to work: ``_on_physics_ready``
        only calls ``set_dof_gains`` when ``_actuated_dof_indices`` is non-empty.
        A bare articulation (no prims) would leave gains at their USD defaults
        and the assertion would never pass even if reinit happened correctly.

        This is faster than asserting on joint motion: only one physics step is
        needed in Phase 2, and there is no ambiguity from residual PhysX drives.

        Why we don't need an explicit og.Controller.evaluate() before replaying
        -----------------------------------------------------------------------
        Changing ``inputs:robotPath`` only updates the attribute value in the
        stage; ``compute()`` is not called until the next ``execIn`` pulse.  That
        pulse arrives automatically from the ``OnPlaybackTick`` connection: the
        first ``next_update_async()`` call after ``app_utils.play()`` fires the
        tick, delivers ``execIn``, and ``compute()`` detects
        ``state._robot_path != robot_path``, calls ``state.release()`` to close
        the old instance, and constructs a fresh ``ArticulationActuators`` for
        the new path.  No extra evaluate call is needed.
