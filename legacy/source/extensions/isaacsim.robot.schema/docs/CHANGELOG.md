# Changelog

## [6.3.6] - 2026-05-29
### Added
- `GetAllRobotComponents` helper (C++ and Python): returns every prim in a robot's subtree that applies any Isaac robot-schema API (`IsaacRobotAPI`, `IsaacLinkAPI`, `IsaacJointAPI`, `IsaacSiteAPI`, `IsaacReferencePointAPI`). Lets consumers enumerate all schema-tagged frames in one call rather than walking `robotLinks` and re-scanning descendants per consumer.

## [6.3.5] - 2026-05-27
### Fixed
- `GenerateRobotLinkTree`: rewrite the two `UsdPrimRange` loops to the conventional range-for shape (`for (const UsdPrim& prim : UsdPrimRange(root))`) instead of treating the range as an iterator. The previous form did not compile and made `utils.h` unincludable from C++ consumers.
- Add `GetRobotLinkParentMap` helper to `utils.h` for resolving `isaac:physics:robotJoints` body0/body1 relationships into a child-link to parent-link path map.

## [6.3.4] - 2026-05-21
### Fixed
- `GenerateRobotLinkTree` now grafts links and physics joints from nested sub-robots (for example a gripper variant attached at a wrist link) onto the parent's kinematic tree, so forward-kinematics propagation moves the entire assembly. Previously, only the sub-robot's bridging link was reachable from the parent tree, leaving sibling links such as gripper knuckles and fingers behind when the arm was teleported by the Robot Poser. Per sub-robot, prims carrying `IsaacRobotLinkAPI` / `IsaacRobotJointAPI` are preferred; bare `UsdPhysicsRigidBodyAPI` / `UsdPhysicsJoint` prims are picked up only when the sub-robot has no tagged equivalents, so unrelated rigid bodies inside a properly authored sub-robot are not added to the tree.

## [6.3.3] - 2026-05-18
### Fixed
- `robot_schema` now imports `pxr.Usd` during module initialization so `pxr.Usd` annotations resolve in standalone wheel environments.

## [6.3.2] - 2026-04-24
### Fixed
- `PopulateRobotSchemaFromArticulation` and `RecalculateRobotSchema` fall back to `robot_prim` as a synthetic articulation root and sweep `Usd.PrimRange` to apply `JointAPI`/`LinkAPI` when BFS yields no chain, ensuring `robotLinks`/`robotJoints` relationships are populated on vehicle and drone assets.

## [6.3.1] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- `get_allowed_tokens(attribute)` helper that reads `allowedTokens` directly from the bundled `RobotSchema.usda` so Python consumers can populate UI choice lists without duplicating the schema's token lists.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-04-22
### Deprecated
- Deprecated `rangeSensorSchema` plugin types: `RangeSensor`, `Lidar`, `Generic` — used only by the deprecated `isaacsim.sensors.physx` extension. Use `IsaacRaycastSensor` with `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.physics` or `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.rtx` instead.
- Deprecated `IsaacLightBeamSensor` from `isaacSensorSchema` — used only by the deprecated `isaacsim.sensors.physx` extension. Use `IsaacRaycastSensor` with `isaacsim.sensors.experimental.physics` instead.
- `omni.isaac.RangeSensorSchema` Python module now emits `DeprecationWarning` on import
- `IsaacLightBeamSensor` Python wrapper now emits `DeprecationWarning` on construction
- Reorganized C++ sensor tokens to separate active from deprecated entries

## [6.2.0] - 2026-04-20
### Added
- `RecalculateRobotSchema` gains `force_update` kwarg that rebuilds `robotLinks`/`robotJoints` and authors cross-layer `deletedItems`.
- New shared `_discover_articulation_graph` helper with a `root_link_override` input for seeding traversal from the user's chosen base link.
- Articulation-root scoring picks the highest-parentness rigid body when the articulation root is a grouping `Xform`.
- Sub-robot boundary handling registers each sub-robot as one collapsed entry at its first boundary joint.
- `SaveRobotSchemaToRobotLayer` flushes composed state onto the layer authoring `IsaacRobotAPI` only, with referenced-layer support via namespace translation.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-04-17
### Added
- Add `IsaacRaycastSensor` USD schema type, plugInfo entry, sensor tokens, and Python compatibility wrapper

### Changed
- `PopulateRobotSchemaFromArticulation` and `RecalculateRobotSchema` now traverse DFS by default, with a `traversal` kwarg (`"dfs"` | `"bfs"`).
- `PopulateRobotSchemaFromArticulation` only registers `RigidBodyAPI` prims as `robotLinks` and `JointAPI` prims as `robotJoints`; grouping Xforms skipped.
- Targets now written as prepend list ops via `_set_targets_as_prepend`, preserving additive composition with downstream layers.
- `_apply_api` is a no-op when the schema is already applied, preventing `apiSchemas` churn on recalc.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-04-15
### Changed
- Migrated `rangeSensorSchema` and `isaacSensorSchema` from pre-built C++ typed schema libraries (`omni-isaacsim-schema` packman package) to codeless USD schemas
- Removed `omni-isaacsim-schema` packman dependency and associated native library entries
- All C++ consumers now use generic `prim.GetAttribute(token)` and `prim.GetTypeName()` instead of typed schema classes
- Added `sensor_tokens.h` header providing token constants for all sensor schema attributes and type names
- Added Python compatibility wrappers (`omni.isaac.RangeSensorSchema`, `omni.isaac.IsaacSensorSchema`) so existing Python consumers work without changes
- Removed ultrasonic sensor schemas (UltrasonicArray, UltrasonicEmitter, UltrasonicFiringGroup, UltrasonicMaterialAPI) — no code references existed
- Added schema validation tests for both sensor schema and range sensor schema plugin registration

## [5.1.3] - 2026-04-02
### Changed
- Replace `carb.log_*` with Python `logging` module
- Replace `omni.usd.get_world_transform_matrix` with pure `pxr` `UsdGeom.Xformable.ComputeLocalToWorldTransform`

## [5.0.0] - 2026-02-23
### Added
- `KinematicChain` class for building and caching joint chains between arbitrary start/end prims on a robot
- Forward Kinematics computation (`compute_fk`) with per-joint intermediate transforms
- Fused FK + spatial Jacobian computation (`compute_fk_and_jacobian`) in a single pass
- `IKSolver` abstract interface and `IKSolverRegistry` for pluggable IK solver implementations
- Levenberg-Marquardt IK solver (`IKSolverLM`) registered as the default solver, with adaptive damping, null-space bias toward joint centers, step clamping, and joint-limit clipping
- `pose_error` function computing 6-DOF orientation + position error between two transforms
- Math module (`math.py`): `Transform` (SE(3) composition and inversion), `Joint` (screw-axis exponential map for revolute and prismatic joints), quaternion operations (`quat_mul`, `quat_conj`, `quat_rotate`, `axis_angle_to_quat`, `quat_to_matrix`), `skew`, and `adjoint`
- Teleport functionality on `KinematicChain`: `teleport` propagates FK through the kinematic tree and writes USD body transforms; `teleport_anchored` applies joints while keeping a specified link fixed via rigid correction
- Zero-configuration pose computation (`_compute_zero_config_poses`) using static joint local frames
- Joint chain path finding via LCA algorithm (`_collect_chain_joints`) returning ordered joints with forward/backward traversal direction
- Named pose query utilities: `GetAllNamedPoses`, `GetNamedPoseStartLink`, `GetNamedPoseEndLink`, `GetNamedPoseJoints`, `GetNamedPoseJointValues`, `GetNamedPoseJointFixed`, `GetNamedPoseValid`
- `CreateNamedPose` for creating `IsaacNamedPose` prims with relationships and attributes
- Loop detection in articulation traversal (`_discover_articulation_prims`, `PopulateRobotSchemaFromArticulation`, `RecalculateRobotSchema`) using visited-set guards to prevent infinite loops in cyclic joint graphs
- `DetectAndApplySites` and `AddSitesToRobotLinks` for automatic site detection on link child Xforms and registration in the robot schema
- `ApplySiteAPI` function; `ApplyReferencePointAPI` deprecated and redirected to `ApplySiteAPI`
- `ValidateRobotSchemaRelationships` returning valid/invalid link and joint lists
- `RecalculateRobotSchema` that preserves existing relationship order while appending newly discovered items and removing invalid ones
- `RebuildRelationshipAsPrepend` and `EnsurePrependListForRobotRelationships` for proper USD layering of robot relationships

### Changed
