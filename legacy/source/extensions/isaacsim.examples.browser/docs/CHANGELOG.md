# Changelog

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-13
### Fixed
- Fixed nvbug 6130501: Example browser detail panel was empty when clicking a synthetic parent category (e.g. "ROS2") whose examples were only registered under sub-categories.
- Added the missing `asyncio` and `omni.kit.app` imports in `property_delegate.py`. The dynamic thumbnail-resize callback referenced both but had no imports, raising `NameError` whenever a selected item had a thumbnail.

### Changed
- Detail view now mirrors a file browser: a category shows its directly-registered examples plus a folder tile for each immediate sub-category. Double-clicking a folder tile drills the tree selection into that sub-category (the selection change is deferred to the next frame so it doesn't tear down the widget tree mid-event).
- Each `ExampleCategoryItem` now owns its examples directly, removing the previous flat-dict / string-prefix lookup in `get_detail_items`.
