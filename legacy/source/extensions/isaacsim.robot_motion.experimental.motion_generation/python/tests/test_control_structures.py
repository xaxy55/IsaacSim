    failure scenarios.

    for positions, velocities, and efforts. It includes flags to control whether reset and forward
    operations should succeed or fail, making it useful for unit testing and validation of controller
    container behavior.

    Key features:
    - Tracks whether the controller has been reset via the ``was_reset`` attribute
    - Can simulate error conditions when ``should_error`` is set to True
    - Returns consistent default joint state with "default" joint name
    - Supports standard BaseController interface for reset and forward operations
