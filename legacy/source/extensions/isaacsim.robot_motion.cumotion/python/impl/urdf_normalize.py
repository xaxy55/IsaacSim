"""URDF normalization helpers for the urdfdom parser used by cuMotion.

cuMotion statically links ``urdfdom`` 4.0.1, which enforces several
strictnesses that go beyond what the URDF spec or other parsers
(``PyBullet``, ``FastUrdfLoader``, MoveIt's earlier loader, ...) require.
The most common one observed in practice is that ``<limit>`` elements lacking
an ``effort`` or ``velocity`` attribute cause the parse to abort with
``joint limit: no effort`` / ``joint limit: no velocity``, even though the
URDFs are otherwise valid and accepted everywhere else.

The functions in this module patch a URDF document in-memory so it satisfies
``urdfdom``'s strictness without changing kinematically meaningful values
(positions, axes, parents, geometry, limits that are already present, ...).
They are intentionally idempotent: a URDF that is already ``urdfdom``-clean
passes through unmodified.

This is the pre-processing step used by
:func:`isaacsim.robot_motion.cumotion.load_cumotion_robot`.
