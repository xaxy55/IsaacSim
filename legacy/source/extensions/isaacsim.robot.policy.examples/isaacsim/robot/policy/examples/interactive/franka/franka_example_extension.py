    This extension provides an interactive example showcasing a Franka Panda robot executing a drawer opening
    policy that was trained in Isaac Lab. The robot attempts to open a drawer in front of it and maintain
    it in an open position. The simulation automatically resets every 10 seconds (simulation time), allowing
    the robot to repeatedly demonstrate the task.

    The extension integrates with the Isaac Sim examples browser, registering itself under the "Policy"
    category as "Franka". It provides a complete UI interface through the BaseSampleUITemplate, including
    documentation links and overview information for users.
