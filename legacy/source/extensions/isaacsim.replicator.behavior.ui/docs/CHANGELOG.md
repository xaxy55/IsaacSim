# Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2026-04-22
### Added
- Subscribe to the `isaacsim.replicator.behavior.EXPOSED_VARS_CHANGED` event and refresh the property window when exposed variables are created or removed. This replaces the direct `omni.kit.window.property.request_rebuild()` calls previously issued from the core behavior scripts, allowing the core extension to be decoupled from any UI module and run headless.
- Guarded the `omni.kit.window.property` import so the UI extension can still be imported in headless contexts (the event handler becomes a no-op).
