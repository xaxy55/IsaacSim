"""Simulation state recorders and replayers.

This package houses the manifest-first HDF5 V2 recorder / replayer system:

- :class:`EpisodeRecorder` — orchestrator for sampling a list of :class:`Recordable`
  plugins into an HDF5 session file.
- :class:`EpisodeReplayer` — best-effort, kinematic, visuals-only replay of such
  sessions.
- :class:`Recordable` — the one plugin protocol; schema + sample + apply + manifest
  round-trip.
- Built-in recordables (``recordables/``) for sim time, articulations, xforms, rigid
  bodies, cameras, USD attributes.

    """Preload h5py's native DLLs on Windows so ``import h5py`` succeeds under Kit.

    The h5py Windows wheel ships ``hdf5.dll``, ``hdf5_hl.dll`` and ``z.dll`` inside
    the ``h5py`` package folder next to the ``.pyd`` extension modules. Under Kit's
    embedded Python, when ``_errors.pyd`` triggers transitive resolution of
    ``hdf5.dll``, the resolved DLL search path does not include ``pip_prebundle/h5py``
    and the import fails with ``DLL load failed while importing _errors: The
    specified module could not be found``.

    Locate ``h5py`` via :func:`importlib.util.find_spec` (which resolves through
    Kit's ``[[python.module]]`` registration and therefore finds the built
    ``pip_prebundle`` regardless of whether the extension is loaded from a source
    checkout via junctions / symlinks), then load the native DLLs explicitly with
    :class:`ctypes.WinDLL` in dependency order (``z`` -> ``hdf5`` -> ``hdf5_hl``).
    Once in the process module cache, subsequent import-table resolution inside
    ``_errors.pyd`` matches them by name and the h5py import succeeds.

    Safe to call multiple times; no-op on non-Windows platforms or when h5py is
    unavailable (e.g. in a source checkout without a built prebundle).
