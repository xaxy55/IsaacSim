"""World / local pose recordable for plain USD Xform prims.

Thin alias over :class:`_PoseBase`. World-space recordables participate in the
recorder's shared pose batch; local-space recordables opt out and go through the
per-recordable ``sample()`` path (local-pose reads have different semantics than
the shared world-pose batch).
