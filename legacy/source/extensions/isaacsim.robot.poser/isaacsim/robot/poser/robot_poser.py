    leaves the solver in a flat region of the cost landscape for many
    7-DOF kinematic structures (Franka Panda, etc.), where it converges

    1. The joint-limit midpoint for joints with finite limits (zeros for

    2. ``n_random`` deterministic uniform-random samples within the
       finite joint limits.  For joints without authored limits the
       sampling range falls back to ``[-1.0, 1.0]`` rad/m so unlimited
       chains still benefit from restarts.
    3. The all-zero configuration (legacy default) as a final fallback.

    Determinism (fixed RNG seed) keeps the cold-start path reproducible
    across runs, across processes, and across machines.  See

        Seeding strategy
        ----------------
        The candidates the solver is started from depend on what the caller
        provides:

        * ``seed=...`` (explicit caller-supplied seed): exactly one solve
          attempt from the given configuration. Lowest latency; recommended
          on hot paths.
        * No ``seed=`` and a cached ``_last_solution``: the cached
          configuration is tried first (lowest latency for tracking targets
          near the previous solve). If that attempt does not converge, the
          full cold-start ladder is run in parallel as a fallback so a
          stale cache cannot trap the solver in the wrong basin.
        * No ``seed=`` and no cached solution: the full cold-start ladder
          (joint-limit midpoint, deterministic random restarts within
          joint limits, and the all-zero configuration) runs in parallel
          via a thread pool. The highest-priority converged result wins.

        On every path, when no candidate converges the lowest-error attempt
        is returned with ``success=False`` and a single warning is logged
        recommending an explicit ``seed=``.

        Parallel ladder execution
        -------------------------
        Cold-start (and ``_last_solution`` fallback) ladders run candidate
        seeds concurrently on a :class:`~concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`.
        The LM solver in this project is stateless and ``chain.compute_fk``
        does not mutate the chain, so the only shared mutable state across
        attempts is the result aggregation, which happens after the threads
        join. The latency of a cold-start ladder is therefore bounded by the
        slowest single solve, not by the sum of all attempts.

        Args:
            target: Desired end-effector pose in the robot-base frame.
            seed: Initial joint-value guess.  When ``None``, uses the last
                successful solution (with cold-start fallback) if available,
                otherwise runs the cold-start ladder directly.
            tolerance: Convergence threshold on the pose-error norm.
            **solver_kwargs: Forwarded to the IK solver (e.g. lam, iters,
                null_space_bias, joint_fixed). joint_fixed can be a dict
                mapping joint prim path to bool to lock DOFs.

        Returns:
            PoseResult with success, joints, and target info.  On failure
            the joints field still contains the lowest-error attempt so
            callers can inspect or visualize near-misses; callers must
            gate calls to :meth:`apply_pose` on ``success`` to avoid
