> [!IMPORTANT]
> **🦀 Rust rewrite in progress.** This fork is incrementally rewriting Isaac Sim in Rust.
>
> - **New Rust code** lives in [`crates/`](crates/) as a Cargo workspace — build with `cargo build` and test with `cargo test` from the repo root.
> - **Status tracking** is in [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md), with one row per legacy extension.
> - **The original C++/Python codebase** has been moved unchanged to [`legacy/`](legacy/) and remains the reference implementation. All build instructions below (e.g. `build.sh`, `repo.sh`) now apply inside the `legacy/` directory.

NVIDIA Isaac Sim™ is a simulation platform built on NVIDIA Omniverse, designed to develop, test, train, and deploy AI-powered robots in realistic virtual environments. It supports importing robotic systems from common formats such as URDF, MJCF, and CAD. The simulator leverages high-fidelity, GPU-accelerated physics engines to simulate accurate dynamics and support multi-sensor RTX rendering at scale. It comes equipped with end-to-end workflows including synthetic data generation, reinforcement learning, ROS integration, and digital twin simulation. Isaac Sim provides the infrastructure needed to support robotics development at any stage.

### Required Software Dependencies

- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/downloads): For version control and repository management

- [**Git LFS**](https://git-lfs.com/): For managing large files within the repository

- **(Windows - C++ Only) Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 or 2026**: 

- Install Visual Studio 2026, Windows SDK, MSVC using Winget by running the following command in PowerShell:

  ```powershell
  winget install --id=Microsoft.VisualStudio.Community -e --override "--add Microsoft.VisualStudio.Workload.NativeDesktop --includeRecommended"
  ```
  
  [Additional information on Windows development configuration](legacy/docs/readme/windows_developer_configuration.md)


- **(Linux) build-essentials**: A package that includes `make` and other essential tools for building applications.  For Ubuntu, install with:

  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install build-essential
  ```

  > **(Linux) ⚠️**
  > Please use GCC/G++ 11, higher versions are not supported yet. To install GCC/G++ 11, run the following commands:
  > ```bash
  > sudo apt-get install gcc-11 g++-11
  > sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-11 200
  > sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-11 200
  > ```

  > **(Linux aarch64) ⚠️**
  > On aarch64 hosts (e.g. DGX Spark), X11 development headers are required to build Python packages that lack pre-built wheels:
  > ```bash
  > sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev xorg-dev
  > ```

  > **Compiler Version Check ⚠️**
  > We have added a version checker to our build process. If you do not have the default versions you are still able to execute a build, add  `--skip-compiler-version-check` to `build.[sh/bat]` when building.  Proceed at your own risk, unsupported build environments may encounter build and runtime issues.

### Recommended Software

- [**(Linux) Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/): For containerized development and deployment. **Ensure non-root users have Docker permissions.**

- [**(Linux) NVIDIA Container Toolkit**](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html): For GPU-accelerated containerized development and deployment. **Installation and Configuring Docker steps are required.**

## Quick Start

This section guides you through building Isaac Sim from source code.

### 1. Clone the Repository


```bash
git clone -b main https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim.git isaacsim
cd isaacsim
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

### 2. Build

Run the following command to initiate the configuration wizard:

**Linux:**

Confirm that GCC/G++ 11 is being used before building using the following commands:

```bash
gcc --version
g++ --version
```

```bash
./build.sh
```

**Windows:**

> **⚠️ Windows Path Length Limitation**
> Windows has a path length limitation of 260 characters. If you encounter errors related missing files or other build errors, try moving the repository to a shorter path.

```powershell
build.bat
```

### 3. Run

> **⚠️ Startup Time**
> The first time loading Isaac Sim may take up to several minutes as Extensions and Shader are loaded and cached. The subsequent startup time should be in the ranges of 10-30 seconds depending on hardware configuration.



Navigate to the corresponding binary directory for your platform and run the executable.

**Linux (x86_64):**
```bash
cd _build/linux-x86_64/release
./isaac-sim.sh
```

**Linux (aarch64):**
```bash
cd _build/linux-aarch64/release
./isaac-sim.sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
cd _build/windows-x86_64/release
isaac-sim.bat
```

> NOTE: If this is your first time building Isaac Sim, you will be prompted to accept the Omniverse Licensing Terms.

## Usage
Congratulations on installing Isaac Sim! To get started with using Isaac Sim, follow these [Quick Tutorials](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/introduction/quickstart_index.html). For more information, visit our full [documentation](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/index.html).

## Additional Build Tools

Beyond building and running from source (see [Quick Start](#quick-start)), Isaac Sim can also be packaged as a standalone binary archive, built as Python wheels, or deployed as a Docker container.

### Binary Package

Build a standalone redistributable binary package from source. A successful [build](#quick-start) is required before packaging.

**Linux:**

```bash
./repo.sh package --config release -m isaac-sim-standalone
```

> **Note:** The same command works on both x86_64 and aarch64 hosts. The build system detects the platform automatically.

**Windows:**

```powershell
.\repo.bat package --config release -m isaac-sim-standalone
```

The packaged archive is written to the `_build/packages/` directory.

### PIP Packages

Build Isaac Sim Python (PIP) wheels locally from a successful [build](#quick-start). Pre-built wheels for released versions are also available on [pypi.nvidia.com](https://pypi.nvidia.com); see [Install Isaac Sim using PIP](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/installation/install_python.html#installation-using-pip) for the install-only path.

A successful [build](#quick-start) is required before packaging.

**Linux:**

```bash
./repo.sh python_package --create
./repo.sh comment_archive_deps
./repo.sh python_package --wheel
```

**Windows:**

```powershell
.\repo.bat python_package --create
.\repo.bat comment_archive_deps
.\repo.bat python_package --wheel
```

The three steps, in order:

1. `python_package --create` stages per-package source trees under `_build/packages/python/` from the wheel definitions in [python_packages.toml](python_packages.toml).
2. `comment_archive_deps` comments out references to Kit pip-archive extensions (`omni.kit.pip_archive`, `omni.isaac.core_archive`, `omni.isaac.ml_archive`, `omni.pip.compute`, `omni.pip.cloud`, `isaacsim.pip.newton`) in the generated `extension.toml` and `*.kit` files so wheel metadata is self-contained.
3. `python_package --wheel` builds the `.whl` files into `_build/packages/dist/`.

Install locally-built wheels into a Python 3.12 virtual environment:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pip install _build/packages/dist/*.whl
```

> **(Linux aarch64) ⚠️**
> On aarch64 hosts, X11 development headers are required to build transitive Python dependencies that lack pre-built aarch64 wheels (same note as under [Prerequisites and Environment Setup](#prerequisites-and-environment-setup)):
> ```bash
> sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev xorg-dev
> ```

### Container (Docker)

For building a Docker image, running with Docker Compose, and web-based streaming, see [tools/docker/README.md](legacy/tools/docker/README.md).


## Troubleshooting

- Please see the [FAQ](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/overview/faq_index.html), [Troubleshooting](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/overview/troubleshooting.html), and [Known Issues](https://docs.isaacsim.omniverse.nvidia.com/latest/overview/known_issues.html) for common questions, fixes, and workarounds.

- On Linux, if you encounter network connectivity issues when building (such as corporate firewalls), run the following commands:

  ```bash
  export http_proxy="http://{Your IP address}:7890"
  export https_proxy="http://{Your IP address}:7890"
  ```

  - Note: The above command should be used only if you have enabled a proxy software or behind a corporate firewall. Port 7890 should be replaced with the proxy port set by the proxy software.
